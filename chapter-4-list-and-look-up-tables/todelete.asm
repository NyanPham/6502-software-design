; This subroutine divides an 8-bit signed dividend in location $21
; by an 8-bit signed divisor in location $20. The 8-bit quotient is
; returned in location $21, replacing the dividend, and the 8-bit
; remainder is returned in location $22. Location $23 is used to hold
; a divisor/dividend sign flag.
